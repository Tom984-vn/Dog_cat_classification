My first self-made image classification model (with help ofc ;) )

14/3/2025: Still quite unsure about how to process rgb 3 channels, cnn model. Still using linear hidden layer and no flatten, pooling and such. Only 70% correction after about 15 epochs

17/3/2025: Learning about CNN models with its layers. Update to the CNN model, contain 3 conv layers with 2 dense layers with max pooling. Also adds betas to the adam optimization. About 85% correction after 15 epochs

23/3/2025: Fine-tuning the model by adding weight reduction for Adam also add reducelronplateau. Reach about 89% corection after 40 epochs
